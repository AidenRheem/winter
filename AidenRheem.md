## Summary

I'm going to be designing a custom 65% keyboard case in Fusion 360, then printing it using PETG on my Prusa MK3S+. After the case is printed, i'll start assembling the keyboard.

## Plan

1. I'll first need to learn how to use Fusion 360. I'll do that for the first 2 weeks using YouTube videos and online tutorials. 
2. After i've learned my way through Fusion, i'll spend about 4 days modeling my case. 
3. I'll then start printing the case, which will take about 2 or 3 days. 
4. After the case is printed, i'll cut out some automotive foam to size, place it inside the case.
5. I'll then take apart every switch, and start lubing the base and stems with Krytox 205g0 and a small paintbrush.
6. Reassemble each switch and snap onto the plate.
7. Connect diodes and solder to each switch using premade wiring guide.
8. Place keycaps over switches and the keyboard is completed.
