project: "Custom Soldered Acrylic Keyboard"

## Summary
I'm going to be creating a custom keyboard using acrylic panels and soldering everything to the PCB, also i'm going to add a knob, big RGB led, and OLED display.

## Plan
I plan to follow this guide on how to build this type of keyboard https://github.com/nullbitsco/docs/blob/main/nibble/build_guide_en.md. But I will need to build the acrylic case on my own by laser cutting acrylic sheets and putting it together.
