## Summary

I'm going to be designing a custom 65% keyboard case in Fusion 360, then printing it using PETG on my Prusa MK3S+. After the case is printed, i'll start assembling the keyboard.

## Plan

1. I'll first need to learn how to use Fusion 360. I'll do that for the first 2 weeks using YouTube videos and online tutorials. 
2. After i've learned my way through Fusion, i'll spend about 4 days modeling my case. 
3. I'll then start printing the case, which will take about 2 or 3 days. 
4. After the case is printed, i'll cut out some automotive foam to size, place it inside the case.
5. Then I need to put in the PCB, a thin piece of foam, put the plate over the foam, then screw all that into the case.
6. After the base is assembled, i'll take apart every switch, lube the base and stems using some Krytox 205g0 and a paint brush, and reassemble each switch.
7. After all switches are lubed, i'll snap them into the PCB and place the keycaps on the switches.
