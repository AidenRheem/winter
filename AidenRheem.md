## Summary
I'm going to be designing a custom 60% keyboard case in Fusion 360, then getting it printed on my Prusa MK3S+. After the case is printed, i'll start assembling the keyboard. I want to use this opportunity to learn how to 3D model in Fusion 360, learning more about keyboard components like learning how to take apart and lube switches, and to build something that I can use in my setup and customize/upgrade overtime.

## Plan
1. I'll first need to learn how to use Fusion 360. I'll do that for the first 2 weeks using YouTube videos and online tutorials. 
2. After i've learned my way through Fusion, i'll spend about 4 days modeling my case and plate. 
3. I'll then send the files over to my Prusa MK3S+, where I can get them 3D printed in 
4. After I recieve the printed parts, i'll cut out some automotive foam to size, and place it inside the case.
5. I want to custom make my own dampening material, so i'll use some foam I already have and use a knife and stencil to cut it out to size.
6. Then I need to put in the PCB, the foam, put the plate over the foam, then screw all that into the case.
7. After the base is assembled, i'll take apart every switch, lube the base and stems using some Krytox 205g0 and a small paint brush, and reassemble each switch.
8. After all switches are lubed, i'll snap them into the PCB and place the keycaps on the switches.
9. Next is to braid and coil the cable. I'll wrap the cable around a marker, and use a heat gun to coil the cable.
10. Keyboard is complete!
